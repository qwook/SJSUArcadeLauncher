tofix/todo:
===========

* A lot of redundancy in entities repeating same code,
should extend. Should make them derive common class.

* Move global variables into a single file.

* World needs to be properly disposed of when resetting.

* Events triggered with the map need better debug support.
    - Should tell you if the object acted upon is nil.
    - Also, there shouldn't be any case sensitivity.

* map.lua needs to abstract more of the Tiled loader.
    - The `Simple Tiled Implementation` library is great,
    but it doesn't have a lot of functions needed to access
    some Tiled properties.
    - We could build a foundation on STI, but later on
    we should not have to depend on it.
